Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to formally request a leave of absence from work for a period of five days, starting from [Starting Date] to [Ending Date].

The reason for my request is a personal health matter that requires immediate attention and treatment. I have developed a skin infection that was triggered by a previous pimple, resulting in dark spots on my back. This condition is causing discomfort and has led me to seek medical treatment. I believe it is necessary to visit my hometown where I can receive the appropriate medical care and attention from my trusted healthcare provider.

I assure you that I understand the importance of my responsibilities and commitments at work. I will ensure that all pending tasks are either completed or handed over to a colleague to ensure a smooth workflow during my absence. I will also be reachable by email should any urgent matters arise that require my attention.

I kindly request your understanding and support in granting me the necessary leave to address this health concern. I am committed to returning to work promptly after my treatment and will make every effort to ensure minimal disruption to our projects and team operations.

Attached to this letter, please find a medical certificate from my healthcare provider confirming the need for this medical leave. I believe this documentation will provide the necessary assurance of the authenticity of my situation.

Thank you for your consideration of my request. I look forward to your positive response and the opportunity to return to work in good health.

Sincerely,
